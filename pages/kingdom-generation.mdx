## THE HISTORY OF THE KINGDOM GENERATION

It was started on 9th September 1990 at Chepkosiom Nursery School. The first pastor to minister in this ministry was pastor Philip Ngetich, who is now Bishop Dr. Philip Ngetich, the senior pastor of Deliverance Church International Kaplong and the regional overseer of South-Rift Kericho.

His first Sunday school children were his own first two children, pastor Peter Langat and Edna. From that year to the year 1993, two youths, Naomi And Stanley (deceased) joined the ministry as teachers. From 1993, other youths volunteered and joined the team and some centers for teaching were established in villages as the church grew. These centers were at the homes of believers, namely: Bishop’s home, Chief Rono’s home, the late Tele’s home, and Tito Kirui’s home. Other volunteers who joined in the ministry were: Vivian Chepngetich and others. Another center was started at the late Koskei’s home at Kiptenden village when he got born again. Another center was started also at pastor Richard Terer’s home in Kapcholyo, madam Sarah Kosgey’s home in Kaplong (sach-ang’wan) and Joseph Cheruiyot’s home.

The late David Koskei was appointed as the first Sunday School Director when the number of centers grew to seven. Later on, madam Sarah Kosgey took over the Sunday School leadership when Brother Koskei passed on in May 5th 2018 a position she holds to date.

The number of teachers has grown to 15 and the children have also grown in number necessitating their being taught in separate classrooms according to their ages, that is 4-6 years, 7-10 years and 11-13 years.

In 2017, the name Sunday school was changed to Kingdom Generation Ministers by their teachers and director and coordinator respectively and all the centers were moved to the main church. These ministers have been trained and have gone through multiple workshops and conferences from time to time. There are also specific teaching guide books for every class which also includes activities such as VBS, and rallies during the long holidays.

We have witnessed great benefits in the ministry as this young generation grow to be responsible and disciplined youths in the society and beyond, reaching the unsaved parents through them. Of course, challenges come our way, but we thank God for them for they make us grow stronger in the word of god.

We are trusting god for great exploits in this ministry to change the society we live in for the Glory of God. Every time, every where and in every way, we confess Christ for man-kind; for us all.
